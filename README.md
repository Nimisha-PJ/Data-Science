Welcome to my Data Science repository! This portfolio showcases my work and learning journey in the field of data science, machine learning, and AI. It contains a variety of projects, assignments, and experiments that reflect my skills in data analysis, statistical modeling, machine learning model development, and deployment. My work focuses on applying data-driven solutions to real-world problems, leveraging tools like Python, SQL, and various machine learning libraries to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets.

Each project in this repository demonstrates my ability to:

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and trends.
Preprocess and clean data to ensure high-quality datasets for modeling.
Build and train machine learning models, ranging from basic regression models to advanced algorithms.
Utilize statistical tools for hypothesis testing, correlation analysis, and distribution fitting.
Visualize data and model results using various plotting techniques and interactive dashboards.
Feel free to explore the individual projects to get an overview of my skills and approach to solving data science challenges.
